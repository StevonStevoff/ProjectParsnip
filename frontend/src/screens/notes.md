Consider a first order language whose vocabulary consists of a single binary
relation, R, and four models: M1 = (D, δ1), M2 = (D, δ2), M3 = (D, δ3) and
M4 = (D, δ4), which all have the same domain of individuals, D = {a, b, c}).
The denotation functions for each of the models are as follows:
M1: δ1(R) = {(a, a), (a, b), (a, c), (b, a), (b, b), (b, c), (c, a), (c, b), (c, c)}
M2: δ2(R) = {(b, a), (b, b), (b, c)}
M3: δ2(R) = {(a, b), (b, a), (c, a)}
M4: δ3(R) = {(a, a)}
For each of the following formulae, state which of the models M1 – M4 satisfy
it, if any:
(a) ∃x[R(x, x)]
(b) ∀x[R(x, x)]
(c) ∀x∀y[R(x, y)]
(d) ∀x∃y[R(x, y)]
(e) ∃x∀y[R(x, y)]
(f) ∃x∃y[R(x, y)]
